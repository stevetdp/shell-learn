emacs

## 1. Quick start

Emacs commands generally involve the CONTROL key (sometimes labeled
CTRL or CTL) or the META key (sometimes labeled EDIT or ALT).  Rather than
write that in full each time, we'll use the following abbreviations:

 C-<chr>  means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>
	  Thus, C-f would be: hold the CONTROL key and type f.
 M-<chr>  means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>.
	  If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the
	  ESC key and then type <chr>.  We write <ESC> for the ESC key.


***Some conventions:***

+ “C” means “Ctrl” and “M” means “Alt”. For example, “M-x” means pressing “Alt” and “X” together.
+ “M-x mycommand” means pressing “Alt” and “X”, input “mycommand”, and press “Enter” key.
+ “RET” means “Enter” key.
